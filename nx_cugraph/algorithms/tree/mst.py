def minimum_spanning_tree(G, weight="weight", algorithm="kruskal", ignore_nan=False):
    """Returns a minimum spanning tree or forest on an undirected graph `G`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph
        An undirected graph. If `G` is connected, then the algorithm finds a
        spanning tree. Otherwise, a spanning forest is found.

    weight : str
       Data key to use for edge weights.

    algorithm : string
       The algorithm to use when finding a minimum spanning tree. Valid
       choices are 'kruskal', 'prim', or 'boruvka'. The default is
       'kruskal'.

    ignore_nan : bool (default: False)
        If a NaN is found as an edge weight normally an exception is raised.
        If `ignore_nan is True` then that edge is ignored instead.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
       A minimum spanning tree or forest.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)
    >>> T = nx.minimum_spanning_tree(G)
    >>> sorted(T.edges(data=True))
    [(0, 1, {}), (1, 2, {}), (2, 3, {})]
